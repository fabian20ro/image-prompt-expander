# Lessons Learned

> This file is maintained by AI agents working on this project.
> It captures validated, reusable insights discovered during development.
> **Read this file at the start of every task. Update it at the end of every iteration.**

## How to Use This File

### Reading (Start of Every Task)
Before starting any work, read this file to avoid repeating known mistakes
and to leverage proven approaches.

### Writing (End of Every Iteration)
After completing a task or iteration, evaluate whether any new insight was
gained that would be valuable for future sessions. If yes, add it to the
appropriate category below.

### Promotion from Iteration Log
Patterns that appear 2+ times in `ITERATION_LOG.md` should be promoted
here as a validated lesson.

### Pruning
If a lesson becomes obsolete (e.g., a dependency was removed, an API changed),
move it to the Archive section at the bottom with a date and reason.

## Architecture & Design Decisions

**[2026-02-15]** FastAPI lifespan + static mounting - In apps already using lifespan hooks, mount static files directly with `check_dir=False` instead of `@app.on_event("startup")` to avoid deprecation warnings and keep startup logic unified.

## Code Patterns & Pitfalls

**[2026-02-07]** Validate model names before importing `mflux` - Importing `mflux` before rejecting unsupported models can trigger native MLX aborts in unsupported test paths.
**[2026-02-07]** Keep docs and signatures aligned - Drift between documented defaults and implementation defaults (`tiled_vae`) causes repeated operator mistake
**[2026-02-24]** Prefer MetadataManager for metadata operations — Direct JSON manipulation of run metadata bypasses validation and path logic; use MetadataManager consistently.s.
**[2026-05-11]** Preserve explicit zero-value gallery layouts — `images_per_prompt: 0` is a real prompt-only layout, so normalize `None` separately instead of coercing all falsy values to 1.
**[2026-05-15]** `uv run` may warn about a mismatched `VIRTUAL_ENV` under Hermes — the project command still uses the repo environment and `uv run pytest --collect-only -q` completed successfully with the warning present.

## Testing & Quality

**[2026-05-13]** Re-verify environment-specific failure notes before preserving them — stale caveats about native imports or toolchain aborts can outlive the real issue, so rerun the narrow test and update the note to the current observed state.
**[2026-02-07]** Prefer intent assertions for worker logs - Worker success/failure paths emit variable extra lines, so tests should assert sequencing/intent rather than exact call counts.
**[2026-02-07]** Use module fakes for MLX-heavy imports - Patching deep `mflux.*` paths can still initialize native MLX/Metal; prefer `patch.dict(sys.modules, ...)` with fake modules.
**[2026-02-24]** Mock external services in tests — Always mock LM Studio and mflux; requiring live GPU or inference server makes tests environment-dependent and fragile.
**[2026-05-14]** Click help output can wrap long option descriptions — when asserting `--help` text, prefer stable substrings over exact single-line matches for defaults embedded in long help strings.

## Performance & Infrastructure

**[2026-02-07]** Open worker logs before long tasks - If log files are opened after pipeline execution starts, early progress information is permanently lost.

## Dependencies & External Services

**[2026-06-20]** mflux caches model families separately — Generated-model weights use `~/.cache/huggingface/hub`, while downloaded LoRAs use `~/Library/Caches/mflux/loras`; inspect both when retiring a model family.
**[2026-06-20]** Use LM Studio's native chat API for Gemma reasoning control — `/api/v1/chat` with `reasoning: "off"` suppresses reasoning output reliably; the OpenAI-compatible endpoint ignored `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking` for `google/gemma-4-26b-a4b-qat`.
**[2026-06-20]** Explicitly load LM Studio models after image-memory handoff — just-in-time chat can race a recent unload and return “model has not started loading/has been unloaded”; query `/api/v1/models`, synchronously call `/api/v1/models/load`, and retry transient load cancellation before chat.
**[2026-04-03]** Use `tool.uv.package = false` for this repo’s flat imports — The code and tests rely on `src/` being executed directly (`uv run python src/cli.py`, pytest path injection). During `uv` migration, keep the repo non-packaged instead of switching to module entrypoints unless imports are refactored first.
**[2026-05-08]** When uv wheel extraction fails with `Operation not permitted` in the default cache, point `UV_CACHE_DIR` at a writable local path like `/tmp/uv-cache` before retrying.

## Process & Workflow

**[2026-02-07]** Emit queue state updates after clear - Emit `queue_updated` together with `queue_cleared` so existing SSE clients refresh immediately.
**[2026-02-07]** Prefer non-blocking UI confirmations - Replacing `alert/confirm` with toast/modal flows reduces disruptive UI pauses and improves task continuity.

## Archive

**[2026-05-14] Archived 2026-06-20** Surface shared quantize behavior in docs/help — Obsolete after the ERNIE-only migration removed public quantization controls and fixed ERNIE q4 plus SeedVR2 q8 internally.
